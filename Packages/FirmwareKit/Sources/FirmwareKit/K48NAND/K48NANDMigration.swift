// The format 2 migration of an A4 or S5L8920 device (k48, n81, n90, n18, n88), an iPod touch 2G (n72), or an iPod
// touch 1G or original iPhone (n45, m68): its legacy NAND store and page overlay become an image store (base/nand,
// read-only) and the device's live NAND, a clone of it with the overlay's pages applied (overlay/nand,
// PreparedDeviceBoot.liveNAND), which the emulator writes in place. Lazy: a boot admission step
// (FirmwareBootAdmission), under the stopped lease, before the first start that needs it. The boards differ only in
// their stores (Store: K48NANDImage's chip files and .dirty bitmaps, PageNANDImage's page directories); the steps are
// the same.
//
//   1. preflight: room for the new base, the live NAND's changes and the volume proof, plus 1 GiB;
//   2. intent work/migration.json (phase building), then build both into migrating/ (Store.convert);
//   3. proof: every page of both images reads as before, byte for byte (Store.verify), and the volumes rebuilt
//      from the new store hash as the ones rebuilt from the old (when the old one rebuilds);
//   4. intent phase committing; renames: base/nand and the overlay's chip files into legacy/, the new base and live
//      NAND into place; then the record, format 2, by an atomic replace;
//   5. legacy/ stays until a session ends in a clean stop (the helper's clean-stop marker), then goes.
//
// A failure before the record swap leaves the device as it was, in format 1 (the emulator still reads it), and the
// next start tries again. An interrupted run is recovered from the intent at the next admission: before the record
// swap the renames are reversed, after it they are finished.
